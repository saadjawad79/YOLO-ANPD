## Custom Training: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov8-object-detection-on-custom-dataset.ipynb]
YOLOv8 Object Detection
Once the dataset version is generated, it has a dataset you can load directly into our notebook for easy training. 


## Deploy model on Roboflow
When the YOLOv8 model is trained, you’ll have a set of trained weights ready for use. These weights will be `best.pt` folder. You can upload your model weights to Roboflow Deploy to use your trained weights on our infinitely scalable infrastructure.
